## Rebuilding in Rust for Good Reason - Eve Porcello

Migrating from writing in JavaScript into Rust. Give the Rust crab all of your money.

General:
Uses **cargo** to create packages. Creates a `Cargo.toml` file. Packages up code into a tidy executable that can be runnable from wherever (using `rustc mainFile.js`)

Benefits found:
- Keeping applications smaller with faster speeds.
- Stricter typing
